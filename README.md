A very simple assistant to help you set up Minecraft servers quickly!

## Backstory
I was tired of having to scramble through websites everytime I needed to make a Minecraft server for testing, so my brightest idea was to build an app that made it automatically for me, call it counter productive if you want, I enjoyed every second of it.
